@article{Ding2017,
abstract = {Practitioners are interested in not only the average causal effect of the treatment on the outcome but also the underlying causal mechanism in the presence of an intermediate variable between the treatment and outcome. However, in many cases we cannot randomize the intermediate variable, resulting in sample selection problems even in randomized experiments. Therefore, we view randomized experiments with intermediate variables as semi-observational studies. In parallel with the analysis of observational studies, we provide a theoretical foundation for conducting objective causal inference with an intermediate variable under the principal stratification framework, with principal strata defined as the joint potential values of the intermediate variable. Our strategy constructs weighted samples based on principal scores, defined as the conditional probabilities of the latent principal strata given covariates, without access to any outcome data. This principal stratification analysis yields robust causal inference without relying on any model assumptions on the outcome distributions. We also propose approaches to conducting sensitivity analysis for violations of the ignorability and monotonicity assumptions, the very crucial but untestable identification assumptions in our theory. When the assumptions required by the classical instrumental variable analysis cannot be justified by background knowledge or cannot be made because of scientific questions of interest, our strategy serves as a useful alternative tool to deal with intermediate variables. We illustrate our methodologies by using two real data examples, and find scientifically meaningful conclusions.},

@article{Efron1991,
abstract = {The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT) measured the effectiveness of the drug cholestyramine for lowering cholesterol levels. The patients in the study were measured for compliance (the proportion of the intended dose actually taken) and for cholesterol decrease. The compliance-response regression for the Treatment group shows a smooth increasing effect of the drug in cholesterol level with increasing compliance. However, a similar, though less dramatic, compliance-response regression is seen in the Control group. This article investigates the recovery of the true dose-response curve from the Treatment and Control compliance-response curves. A simple model is proposed, analyzed, and applied to the LRC-CPPT data. Under this model, part but not all of the true dose-response curve can be estimated},

@article{Jin2008,
abstract = {Many double-blind placebo-controlled randomized experiments with active drugs suffer from complications beyond simple noncompliance. First, the compliance with assigned dose is often partial, with patients taking only part of the assigned dose, whether active or placebo. Second, the blinding may be imperfect in the sense that there may be detectable positive or negative side effects of the active drug, and consequently, simple compliance has to be extended to allow different compliances to active drug and placebo. Efron and Feldman presented an analysis of such a situation and discussed inference for dose–response from the nonrandomized data in the active treatment arm, which stimulated active discussion, including on the role of the intention-to-treat principle in such studies. Here, we formulate the problem within the principal stratification framework of Frangakis and Rubin, which adheres to the intention-to-treat principle, and we present a new analysis of the Efron–Feldman data within this framework. Moreover, we describe precise assumptions under which dose–response can be inferred from such nonrandomized data, which seem debatable in the setting of this example. Although this article only deals in detail with the specific Efron–Feldman data, the same framework can be applied to various circumstances in both natural science and social science.},

Here, I argue that the notion of principal stratification has shed light on problems of non-compliance, censoring-by-death, and the analysis of post-infection outcomes; that it may be of use in considering problems of surrogacy but further development is needed; that it is of some use in assessing "direct effects"; but that it is not the appropriate tool for assessing "mediation." There is nothing within the principal stratification framework that corresponds to a measure of an "indirect" or "mediated" effect.},

@article{Angrist1995,
abstract = {Abstract: Two-stage least squares (TSLS) is widely used in econometrics to estimate parameters in systems of linear simultaneous equations and to solve problems of omitted-variables bias in single-equation estimation. We show here that TSLS can also be used to estimate the average causal effect of variable treatments such as drug dosage, hours of exam preparation, cigarette smoking, and years of schooling. The average causal effect in which we are interested is a conditional expectation of the difference between the outcomes of the treated and what these outcomes would have been in the absence of treatment. Given mild regularity assumptions, the probability limit of TSLS is a weighted average of per-unit average causal effects along the length of an appropriately defined causal response function. The weighting function is illustrated in an empirical example based on the relationship between schooling and earnings.

@article{Bartolucci2011,
abstract = {Within the principal stratification framework for causal inference, modeling partial compliance is challenging because the continuous nature of the principal strata raises subtle specification issues. In this context, we propose an approach based on the assumption that the joint distribution of the degree of compliance to the treatment and the degree of compliance to the control follows a Plackett copula, so that their association is modeled in a flexible way through a single parameter. Moreover, given the two compliances, the distribution of the outcomes is parameterized in a flexible way through a regression model which may include interaction and quadratic terms and may also be heteroscedastic. In order to estimate the parameters of the resulting model, and then the causal effect of the treatment, we adopt a maximum likelihood approach via the EM algorithm. In applying this approach, the marginal distributions of the two compliances are estimated by their empirical distribution functions, so that no constraints are posed on these distributions. Since the two compliances cannot be jointly observed, there is not direct empirical support for the association parameter. We describe a strategy for studying this parameter by a profile likelihood method and discuss an analysis of the sensitivity of the causal inference results to its value. We apply the proposed approach to data from a study about a drug for lowering cholesterol levels previously analyzed by Efron and Feldman and by Jin and Rubin. Estimated causal effects are in line with those of previous analyses, but the pattern of association between the compliances is qualitatively different, apparently due to the flexibility of the copula and to allowing regression equations in the proposed method to include interactions and heteroscedasticity.},

@article{Schwartz2011,
abstract = {In causal inference studies, treatment comparisons often need to be adjusted for confounded post-treatment variables. Principal stratification (PS) is a framework to deal with such variables within the potential outcome approach to causal inference. Continuous intermediate variables introduce inferential challenges to PS analysis. Existing methods either dichotomize the intermediate variable, or assume a fully parametric model for the joint distribution of the potential intermediate variables. However, the former is subject to information loss and arbitrary choice of the cutoff point and the latter is often inadequate to represent complex distributional and clustering features. We propose a Bayesian semiparametric approach that consists of a flexible parametric model for the potential outcomes and a Bayesian nonparametric model for the potential intermediate outcomes using a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model. The DPM approach provides flexibility in modeling the possibly complex joint distribution of the potential intermediate outcomes and offers better interpretability of results through its clustering feature. Gibbs sampling based posterior inference is developed. We illustrate the method by two applications: one concerning partial compliance in a randomized clinical trial, and one concerning the causal mechanism between physical activity, body mass index, and cardiovascular disease in the observational Swedish National March Cohort study.},
